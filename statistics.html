                            <center><p><small>
                                The calculated correlation of approximately 0.35 between the likeliness of someone learning how to control rat infestation in NYC and their level of concern about rats indicates a moderate correlation between the two variables, as shown by the table above.
                                From the pivot table, we found that the majority of respondents who expressed concern about rats are most likely to seek valuable information on how to deal with them.
                                 Meanwhile, respondents who fell in the categories of neutral or expressed signs of unconcern tend to lean towards not being interested in learning about methods to handle rats.
                                  It could be seen that approximately 78.9% of respondents are interested in learning about solutions to deal with rats, with the majority of the percentage coming from people who expressed a sign of concern about rats.
                                  About 21.1% of respondents who either were unsure or not likely to learn ways to control rat infestation came from respondents who expressed less concern about rats (See Figure 1).
                                  In conclusion, these results suggest that residents who are concerned about rodents are more likely to challenge themselves to learn about ways to deal with them, unlike people who show signs of unconcernedness.

                                    According to the data chart shown above, approximately 24.6% of respondents are either familiar or very familiar with the law regulations regarding trash disposal in NYC, while 7.8% of  respondents are unsure about the law regulations.
                                    Furthermore, 67.6% respondents are either not at all familiar or only somewhat familiar with the law regulations regarding trash disposal in NYC; thus, more than half of the respondents are not familiar with the law regulations (See Figure 2 Above).
                                    As a result of our data, it can be inferred that residents who aren’t familiar with the law regulations may be unaware of waste disposal needing to be inside a tied plastic bag or placed in a trash can with a lid.

                                    According to our chart above, 22.5% of respondents either are willing or very willing to join programs that are involved in getting rid of rats, while approximately 25.5% of respondents are somewhat willing to join.
                                     Meanwhile, roughly 42.2% of respondents are not even willing to join programs that are involved in getting rid of rats.
                                     Additionally, 9.8% of respondents are unsure about their involvement in joining the programs (See Figure 3 Above).
                                    More than one-third of the participants are not willing to join programs that are involved in getting rid of rats, so perhaps respondents may already know about the harmful diseases rats can cause but are unsure about the disease they may transmit.
